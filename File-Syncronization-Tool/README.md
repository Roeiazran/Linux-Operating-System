This program implements a file system synchronization tool in C. It compares files between two directories and copies newer or missing files from a source directory to a destination directory. This utility demonstrates the use of key system calls such as chdir(), getcwd(), fork(), exec(), and wait().
Objectives:
1. Gain hands-on experience with file system navigation using chdir() and getcwd().
2. Practice process creation and management with fork(), exec(), and wait().
3. Learn to work with directory contents and file attributes.
